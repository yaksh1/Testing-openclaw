# Project: MoodRing

An ambient browser companion that senses your emotional state from browsing patterns and responds with subtle, calming interventions.

## Concept

Your browser knows more about your mental state than you think:
- Rapid tab switching = anxiety
- Doom scrolling = numbness  
- Re-reading same page = confusion
- Late night activity = insomnia risk

MoodRing observes (locally, privately) and responds with:
- Ambient color shifts in browser chrome
- Micro-break reminders
- Breathing exercises
- Context-aware suggestions

## Tech Stack

- Chrome Extension (Manifest V3)
- Local ML for mood detection (TensorFlow.js)
- No external APIs, no data leaves your device
- SQLite for local pattern storage

## Philosophy

Not a productivity tool. Not a blocker. A gentle, ambient companion that makes the web feel more humane.
