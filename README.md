# MoodRing

An ambient browser companion that senses your emotional state from browsing patterns and responds with subtle, calming interventions.

## What It Does

MoodRing observes how you browse (locally, privately) and responds with gentle ambient interventions:

- **Rapid tab switching** → Calming green glow + breathing suggestion
- **Doom scrolling** → Warm orange hint to take a break
- **Too many tabs open** → Suggestion to close a few
- **Late night browsing** → Purple tint + sleep nudge

## Installation

1. Clone this repo
2. Open Chrome → Extensions → Developer mode ON
3. Load unpacked → Select this folder
4. Pin the extension to see your mood ring

## Features
