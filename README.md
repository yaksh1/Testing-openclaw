# SyncSpace

A shared browsing presence for couples and close friends. Feel together, even when apart.

## What It Does

SyncSpace creates a subtle, ambient connection between two people browsing the web:

- **Presence Glow** — Soft pulse when your partner is online
- **Gentle Nudge** — Send a "thinking of you" pulse to their screen
- **Sync Sessions** — Browse in shared focus mode with ambient sync
- **Together Streaks** — Days you've both been online
- **Mood Match** — Subtle color shifts when you're both calm/focused

## How It Works

1. **Pair Once** — Share a simple code to connect (peer-to-peer, no server)
2. **Browse Normally** — SyncSpace runs quietly in background
3. **Feel Connected** — Subtle ambient cues when you're both online

## Features

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| 💫 Presence Ring | Soft glow around screen edge when partner is online |
| 🤝 Sync Mode | Both screens share ambient color when focused |
| 💌 Nudge | Double-tap icon to send a gentle pulse to partner |
| 🔥 Streak | Count consecutive days you've both been online |

## Privacy

- **100% Peer-to-Peer** — Direct WebRTC connection, no central server
- **No Data Stored** — Nothing leaves your browsers
- **No Chat History** — Just presence, no messages to leak
- **Disconnect Anytime** — Unpair with one click

## For Couples

Long distance? Different schedules? SyncSpace keeps a thread of connection without demanding attention. No "why didn't you reply" — just a gentle reminder you're both out there, browsing, living.
